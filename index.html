            The year was 2020, One month after Edinburgh had went into Lockdown. I finished my work for the day and decided to head up to my local trails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trail I head up to is a steep hill, just off the main path that heads up to the Bonaly Resevoir. This particular trail is known as 'Bonaly Downhill' and is a popular mountain biking destination for locals
            and riders outside of the Edinburgh area.
