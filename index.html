            The year was 2020, One month after Edinburgh had went into Lockdown. I finished my work for the day and decided to head up to my local trails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trail I head up to is a steep hill, just off the main path that heads up to the Bonaly Resevoir. This particular trail is known as 'Bonaly Downhill' and is a popular mountain biking destination for locals
            and riders outside of the Edinburgh area.

            Despite worldwide lockdown fast approaching, I managed to sneak a trip to Helsinki to take a break from work and also try my hand at ice swimming. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The weather was - as you would expect - bright, but freezing. At one point, I had to go into a pharmacy to get some ointment for my knuckles as the skin started cracking and bleeding.
            I tried some local finnish food such as deer and bear. Which was absolutely nothing like ive ever had before.

            This is a beach / shore walk I did with my friends in January of 2020. In the distance, you can see some people walking out in bathing gear to swim in the Irish Sea

            Northern Ireland is my second home. And i am proud to call it so. The city of Belfast has an incredible social scene, with more than 3 rooftop bars available in the city (3 more than my hometown of Edinburgh!)
