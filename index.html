          <h2>Edinburgh, Scotland - April 2020 <img src = "img/small_scotland_flag.png" alt="" class="small_flag"></h2>
          <p>
            The year was 2020, One month after Edinburgh had went into Lockdown. I finished my work for the day and decided to head up to my local trails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trail I head up to is a steep hill, just off the main path that heads up to the Bonaly Resevoir. This particular trail is known as 'Bonaly Downhill' and is a popular mountain biking destination for locals
            and riders outside of the Edinburgh area. <a href="./" class="blog_link"> Read More..</a>

          <h2>Helsinki, Finland - March 2020 <img src = "img/small_finland_flag.png" alt="" class="small_flag"></h2>
          <p>
            Despite worldwide lockdown fast approaching, I managed to sneak a trip to Helsinki to take a break from work and also try my hand at ice swimming. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The weather was - as you would expect - bright, but freezing. At one point, I had to go into a pharmacy to get some ointment for my knuckles as the skin started cracking and bleeding.
            I tried some local finnish food such as deer and bear. Which was absolutely nothing like ive ever had before.<a href="./" class="blog_link"> Read More..</a>

          <h2>Belfast, N. Ireland - January 2020 <img src = "img/small_ireland_flag.png" alt="" class="small_flag"></h2>
          <p>
            This is a beach / shore walk I did with my friends in January of 2020. In the distance, you can see some people walking out in bathing gear to swim in the Irish Sea
          </p>
          <p>
            Northern Ireland is my second home. And i am proud to call it so. The city of Belfast has an incredible social scene, with more than 3 rooftop bars available in the city (3 more than my hometown of Edinburgh!)
