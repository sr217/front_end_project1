Notes on Project - 06/09/2020

--index.html--

Nav Bar

The navbar's only functionality is as follows:

* The 'Stuart's Adventures' text acts as a link back to the index page.
* 'Project', 'Subscribe' and 'About' are not linked to any pages.

Archive Bar

The archive's purpose is to act as 'folders'. Currently, these are all dead links also. And is there purely for the design of the webpage.

Blog Post

* Each image 'bounces' when its selected. This is to make it look like its an easy to click button to take you to the blog post. This feature is only functional on the blog post titled 'Edinburgh, Scotland - April 2020'. 

Footer

* The social media images inside the footer's can be clicked, but take the user to a dead page.

--blogpost.html--

No notes to add regarding this particular page.

--Potential Next Ideas--

* Color scheme is fairly dull. To take the website to a modern attractive colour scheme would look more impressive.

* One way to implement this website would be to implement it as an MVC Solution with Visual Studio / .NET. This is so I could make a master page for the nav bar without duplicating a whole HTML document everytime I want to create a new page.
